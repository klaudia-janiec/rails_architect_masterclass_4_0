# Week 2 Notes

> **CQRS** - allows to extract views from main codebase\
**Event sourcing** - allows to extract persistence from main codebase\
**Domain logic** - code without persistance and views

### Domain model - possible solution

> **Tactical DDD** - focus of items used to build the model (value object, entity, aggregate, domain event etc)

> **Strategic DDD** - map vocabulary to the codebase, ubiquitous language (bounded context, context map etc)

### Strategic DDD

> **Ubiquitous language** - business language

> **Event storming** - the way to learn business language, design domain model.\
Domain event - what is happening in the domain\
Command - someone intention, action\
Business rule - part of system reacting to command
